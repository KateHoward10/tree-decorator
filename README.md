# Emoji Tree Decorator
üéÑA customisable Christmas tree!

### Created svg tree
First of all, I created a basic tree in Sketch. As you can see it‚Äôs comprised of four overlapping, mathematically beautiful right-angled triangles.
```
<svg width="420px" height="507px" viewBox="0 0 420 507">
    <g id="Artboard" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd">
        <polygon id="Triangle" fill="#507E1A" points="210 0 330 120 90 120"></polygon>
        <polygon id="Triangle" fill="#507E1A" points="210 60 360 210 60 210"></polygon>
        <polygon id="Triangle" fill="#507E1A" points="210 135 390 315 30 315"></polygon>
        <polygon id="Triangle" fill="#507E1A" points="210 225 420 435 0 435"></polygon>
        <rect id="Rectangle" fill="#8B572A" x="180" y="435" width="60" height="72"></rect>
    </g>
</svg>
```
### Added tree topper selector
I started off with something basic, which was the decoration to sit at the top of the tree. Traditionally, this is either a star or an angel, although the Apple angel emoji is a quite creepy baby with wings but no body. When the option selected in this control changes, the handleChange function sets that as the textContent of the topSelector div. Easy!
```
<div class="controls">
	<select name="toppers">
		<option value="üëº">üëº</option>
		<option value="‚≠ê">‚≠ê</option>
	</select>
</div>
<script>
	const topSelector = document.querySelector('select');
	const topper = document.querySelector('.topper');
	function handleChange() {
		topper.textContent = topSelector.value;
	}
	topSelector.addEventListener('change', handleChange);
</script>
```

### Added Add Present
In a similar vein, I added an event listener to a button labelled Add present, which adds a present emoji to the textContent of the present container (making sure to set its width to match that of the tree, or it all ends up a mess).

### Baubles
Time to make things a bit more interesting. I went back to Sketch to add baubles on each branch, then set about letting the user set their colour. This was done with custom CSS variables, which are set on the root element...
```
<style>
	:root {
		--primary-colour: #ff0000;
		--secondary-colour: #DAA520;
	}
</style>
```
...referenced in the fill attribute for each bauble in the HTML...
```
<circle cx="106" fill="var(--primary-colour)" cy="136" r="16"></circle>
<circle cx="346" fill="var(--secondary-colour)" cy="136" r="16"></circle>
<circle cx="74" fill="var(--secondary-colour)" cy="226" r="16"></circle>
<circle cx="376" fill="var(--primary-colour)" cy="226" r="16"></circle>
<circle cx="46" fill="var(--primary-colour)" cy="331" r="16"></circle>
<circle cx="406" fill="var(--secondary-colour)" cy="331" r="16"></circle>
<circle cx="16" fill="var(--secondary-colour)" cy="451" r="16"></circle>
<circle cx="436" fill="var(--primary-colour)" cy="451" r="16"></circle>
```
...and controlled via the values of a couple of colour pickers in the JS.
```
const colourPickers = document.querySelectorAll('.colour-picker');
function changeColour() {
	document.documentElement.style.setProperty(`--${this.name}`, this.value);
}
colourPickers.forEach(picker => picker.addEventListener('change', changeColour));
```

### Decorations
I was getting a bit bored with the flat tree at this point and added a few shadows using Sketch (with some inner shadows for the baubles) to make it look marginally more realistic.
Now that it was 3-D the tree called out for more decorations. I added a click event listener to the tree itself that adds a div to the DOM, setting its top and left values according to the coordinates of the MouseEvent (e.clientX and e.clientY). Its textContent is set to the value of a `<select>` element, filled with an increasing variety of emojis that vaguely resemble Christmassy ornaments.
```
const decSelector = document.querySelector('.decorations');
const mainTree = document.querySelector('.main-tree');
function placeDecoration(e) {
	if (decSelector.value !== "") {
		const decoration = document.createElement('div');
		decoration.textContent = decSelector.value;
		decoration.classList.add('decoration');
		// minus 15 to account for the decorations‚Äô size of 30px
		decoration.setAttribute("style", `top: ${e.clientY}px; left: ${e.clientX - 15}px;`);
		tree.appendChild(decoration);
		decoration.setAttribute("x", `${e.clientY}`);
		decoration.setAttribute("y", `${e.clientX}`);
		decoration.setAttribute("style", "font-size: 2em; z-index: 100");
		mainTree.appendChild(decoration);
	}
}
mainTree.addEventListener('click', placeDecoration);
```
Being absolutely positioned, the decorations didn‚Äôt really work when the browser later got resized. I sneakily solved this problem by moving the tree into the top left and compensating for its padding/margin in the values for the decorations‚Äô coordinates, after an embarrassingly long time trying to add new svg text elements to the tree instead.
When I came to add lights (i.e. `<circle />`s with a radius of 3px) I worked out the trick behind this, which wasn‚Äôt all that difficult: `const light = document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", 'circle');` rather than `const light = document.createElement('circle');`

### Twinkly lights
Next, I wanted to make the lights twinkly. This was done with a function that changes their rgba colour every second, selecting a random value for b (which makes it somewhere between white and yellow, as r and g are set to maximum) and a, which makes it anything from transparent to opaque. It‚Äôs quite subtle and fairly twinkly, although sometimes it does look like all the lights have broken.
```
function twinkle() {
	if (lightsContainer.hasChildNodes()) {
		Array.from(lightsContainer.querySelectorAll('circle')).forEach(light => {
			light.setAttribute('r', `${Math.random()+1}`);
		});
	}
}
setInterval(twinkle, 500);
twinkle();
```
### Let it snow
For some reason, I decided to conjure up JavaScript snow using a "Let it snow! ‚ùÑÔ∏è" button to call `letItSnow()`, which includes two nested functions, `createFlake()` and `snowfall()`.
`createFlake()` creates an absolutely positioned `<div>` which starts off with its top set to 0px, and left set to a random number within the width of the tree. `snowfall()` increases the `top` value by 1px at a random interval, so each one falls down the screen at their own speed.

This was lovely but as the flakes kept falling forever it made my laptop whir quite a lot, so I made each flake remove itself from the DOM when its top exceeded the height of the tree. This led to a few simple styling changes to add some snowy ground (a white div with a width of 100%), and a limit on the number of presents so they wouldn't look silly with snow disappearing halfway down them.

As the whirring persisted I set about making it possible to stop new snow being created. Originally this was attempted using the same button, which toggled its textContent from "Let it snow! ‚ùÑÔ∏è" to "Stop, it's too snowy üå®Ô∏è" when clicked, and used this textContent value to determine what function to perform. This all got horribly confusing and led me to look into various solutions, such as a simple `return;` to exit the letItSnow function, and custom errors with a throw statement.

None of this worked, and what I had missed was that the two buttons have to do two separate things - `letItSnow()` and `stopSnow()`. This was also much easier once they were actually two different buttons (which each toggle the other to a hidden class when clicked, so they appear to be the same button). They do both need to refer to `snowing`, the value returned by setting an interval on the `createFlake()` function. Crucially, I had to set `snowing` to `null` outside both functions, so that `clearInterval()` could be called on it.

```
const snowButton = document.getElementById('snow-button');
const stopButton = document.getElementById('stop-button');
const snowContainer = document.querySelector('.snow-container');
let snowing = null;

function letItSnow() {
	stopButton.classList.remove("hidden-button");
	snowButton.classList.add("hidden-button");
	function createFlake() {
		let flake = document.createElement('div');
		flake.classList.add('snowflake');
		flake.style.top = '0px';
		flake.style.left = `${Math.random() * 552}px`;
		snowContainer.appendChild(flake);
		function snowfall() {
			let topValue = parseInt(flake.style.top.slice(0, flake.style.top.length-2), 10);
			if (topValue < 650) {
				flake.style.top = `${topValue + 1}px`;
			} else {
				flake.remove();
			}
		}
		setInterval(snowfall, (Math.random() * 100) + 10);
		snowfall();
	}

	snowing = setInterval(createFlake, 2000);
}

function stopSnow() {
	snowButton.classList.remove("hidden-button");
	stopButton.classList.add("hidden-button");
	clearInterval(snowing);
}
snowButton.addEventListener('click', letItSnow);
stopButton.addEventListener('click', stopSnow);
```
